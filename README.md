# Deadwood

Deadwood is a free boardgame by [Cheapass Games](https://cheapass.com/free-games/deadwood/). This game was the quarter-long project for my Object Oriented 
Programming class, using Java, Java Swing, and XML.

# How to Play:

Compile and run Deadwood.java. No command line arguments, simple as that.
